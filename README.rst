The Robot Cooperative
=====================

This repository is designed to make it easier for software engineering and
robotics researchers to interact with and experiment on robot software by
providing Docker images for a variety of open-source robots written for the
Robot Operating System.
Each Docker image is accompanied by example code and usage instructions,
and can be used to launch a robot in simulation using Gazebo,
and comes with VNC support for visualisation.
(For some images, we also provide GzWeb support as an experimental, alternative
means of visualisation.)
